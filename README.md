Search Form - enter text here
Search Button - click to start search
Search History - this is where current/previous queries would end up

If the user failed to enter a city name and clicks the search button, an alert message will show up.

UV field is color coded:
If the UV index is less than 3, the color would be green.
If the UV index is 4 to 5, the color would be yellow.

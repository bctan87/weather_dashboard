Search Form - enter text here
Search Button - click to start search
Search History - this is where current/previous queries would end up
Weather Info Window - this is where the weather data, pertaining to the user input, would populate
5 Day Forecast Window - this is where the 5 day weather forecast data, pertaining to the user input, would populate

If the user fails to enter a city name and clicks the search button, an alert message will show up.

If the query is successful, all empty fields would be populated

Although not in the AC, the weather description was added to supplement the weather icon.

UV field is color coded:
If the UV index is less than 3, the color would be green.

If the UV index is 4 to 6, the color would be yellow.

If the UV index is 7 and up, the color would be red.
